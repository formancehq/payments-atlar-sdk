# Atlar SDK

This project is not affiliated with, maintained or supported by Atlar AB.

The directories `v*` contain independent clients for the respective version of the Atlar API. This approach is necessary for now, as not all features available in v1 are covered by the API v2.

Versioning of this packages is independent from API versioning and merely reflects changes in the architecture of `goswagger`, which is used to generate these clients.
